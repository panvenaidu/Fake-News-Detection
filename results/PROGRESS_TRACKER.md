## BERT completion execution — 9 October 2026

BERT text-only six-class baseline is complete: six epochs, epoch4 selected; validation82.7407% accuracy/77.8682% Macro-F1; test82.3901%/77.4566% on all59319 rows. Test exceeds paper76.77% by5.6201 percentage points, reaching+1-point target. Both archives,69 manifest members and allprediction metrics/IDs verified. Model/optimizer/scheduler/AMP/tokenizer load and completed-result idempotence passed. Final epoch6 checkpoint and selected weights stored locally/private cloud. Original data/config/source/history retained. Text100%, full text+image40%, image20%, overall53%; pilot100% separately. No active cloud GPU job; Kaggle quota29h09m remaining at final observation.

BERT baseline complete. Read results/TEXT_ONLY_FINAL_REPORT_20261009.md; register a separate future ModernBERT comparison or full multimodal cohort before any new training. Final GitHub verification is recorded in the requirement audit.
