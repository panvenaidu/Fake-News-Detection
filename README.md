## BERT completion execution — 9 October 2026

Recovered epoch5 finished and validated: accuracy82.8031%, Macro-F177.8388%, matching the historical Colab observation. Epoch5/batch17625 session checkpoint saved successfully. Epoch6 is active (batch500 observed, finite loss0.1430, throughput279.9 titles/s); frozen full official splits remain unchanged. Epoch4 is still selected by validation Macro-F1. This is the same BERT attempt continued; ModernBERT and another model were not launched. Final test and local archival remain pending.

Continue observing this exact saved job. Finish remaining epoch5, then epoch6 or the registered early-stop rule. Keep original input checkpoint as durable fallback; new Kaggle working checkpoints become durable only after saved outputs are verified. Freeze validation-selected weight hash, export full validation/test evidence, retrieve weights and independently verify metrics/IDs before claiming completion.

## Text completion execution — 9 October 2026

The user approved `TEXT-COMPLETE-v1`. Versioned BERT-only recovery passed the original-checkpoint, sample-order and optimizer/AMP recovery gates. Private Kaggle input staging is in progress; no resumed GPU step or final text test is verified yet. Original data, weights, source/config and five-epoch observations are preserved. Current execution: `results/text_completion_execution_20261009.json`.

## Latest handoff - 9 October 2026: text completion plan ready

Read `context/TEXT_COMPLETION_PLAN_20261009.md` first. User requested a detailed GPT-6 Sol handoff and will approve execution next. This session audited data/code/evidence and saved a plan; no GPU training or final test was run. All official TSVs were rescanned and saved weight hashes reverified. Kaggle inspection: no active jobs, draft off, quota 00:06 / 30h used (about 29h54m remaining at observation).

**New prerequisite:** original mid-epoch resume changes sample order when fresh workers consume the sampler generator. CPU reproduction and actual checkpoint RNG inspection confirmed the mismatch. Saved weights are intact; repair and verify resume ordering before running the prepared recovery notebook. Also make a BERT-only job and export the missing full validation prediction CSV. Preserve original source/config/history; record versioned recovery changes. See `results/text_resume_order_diagnostic_20261009.json` and `results/TEXT_COMPLETION_PLAN_AUDIT_20261009.json`.

**Usage reserve:** start syncing around 25% remaining; at 20% start no new experiment and use the reserve to update all context/log/status files and safely commit/push. Leave a healthy submitted cloud job running independently; record its exact state and durable outputs. Do not imply local/GitHub updates happen while the agent is inactive. Latest planning check: 24% five-hour / 57% weekly remaining; finish documentation and handoff now.

Progress unchanged: BERT73%, full text+image40%, image-only20%, overall44%; multimodal pilot100% separately. BERT has five observed training/validation epochs, saved epoch5 batch15000, final test pending. A later approval to execute the saved plan authorizes its implementation and training sequence. Earlier entries below are historical where they conflict with this note.

## Current state — 8 October 2026, completed multimodal pilot

**Text-only, official full cohort:** BERT-base completed five training/validation epochs. Selected epoch4 has validation accuracy **82.7407%** and Macro-F1 **77.8682%**. Epoch5 accuracy **82.8031%**, Macro-F1 **77.8388%** did not replace the selected checkpoint. The trainer failed writing recovery metadata at the end of epoch5; Colab GPU allocation is blocked by usage limits. **Final test pending. ModernBERT not started.** Original five-epoch history is retrieved. Original tensor integrity is verified at epoch5 batch15000/17625, before epoch completion; resume will replay the remaining2625 batches of epoch5. Verification: `results/bert_recovery_verification.json`. No BERT recovery job is currently running.

**Text+image, engineering pilot:** BERT-base + ResNet-50 maximum fusion **completed three GPU epochs and a final test** on Kaggle version2, scriptVersionId356486031. Pilot: **2,000 train / 300 validation / 300 test**, all six classes, unchanged official split membership. Selected epoch3: validation **79.33% accuracy / 59.62% Macro-F1**; test **74.33% accuracy / 55.90% Macro-F1**. 188 optimizer updates, one AMP skip; 297.9-second notebook run. Original metrics, history, class reports, confusion matrices and GPU environment are synced to `results/experiments/multimodal/MM-PILOT-6W-v1_seed42_20261009/`; weights/checkpoints remain preserved in the private saved Kaggle output. All300 validation and300 test original predictions are now synced locally and verified against the official pilot IDs/labels. This is **not an official full-cohort benchmark**, not “50% of training”, and not evidence of outperforming the paper. Imposter test F1 is zero on six examples.

**Next:** privately attach the verified recovery archive and `data/cloud_recovery/recovery_verification.json` to Kaggle, then use `notebooks/UROP_KAGGLE_TEXT_RECOVERY_20261009.ipynb` to resume the unchanged original text protocol. It finishes BERT before ModernBERT; preserve the original Colab environment plus Kaggle resume environment. Do not rerun the completed multimodal pilot. `results/FACULTY_STATUS_20261009.md` is the short faculty summary. The earlier entries below describe historical observations and are superseded by this current section.

> Historical snapshot before interruption: official text training was active: BERT epoch-4 validation accuracy **82.74%**, Macro-F1 **77.87%** (original metrics retrieved). Epoch 5 running; selected checkpoint currently epoch 4 by Macro-F1; final test pending; ModernBERT queued. Finite status display repaired; trainer/GPU activity verified independently. Kaggle phone verified, 0/30 GPU hours used as last checked. See [current context](context/RESUME_HERE.md) and [live evidence](results/official_text_live_status.json).

> **Current update (2026-10-08):** Official full-cohort training is documented in `context/AUDIT_20261008.md`. Earlier 75,995-subset results remain historical. Four original full-precision validation observations and small cloud evidence are synchronized locally; final test and predictions are pending.

# Multimodal Fake News Detection Using Text + Image

A university research project investigating multimodal fake news detection using the [Fakeddit](https://fakeddit.netlify.app/) dataset.

## Overview

This project explores improving multimodal (text + image) fake news detection, focusing on robustness and generalization. We use the Fakeddit benchmark dataset, which contains over 1 million samples with 2-way, 3-way, and 6-way classification labels.

**Reference Paper:** "Fake News Detection: It's All in the Data!" (Applied Sciences, 2026)

**Dataset Paper:** Nakamura, Levy, Wang. "r/Fakeddit: A New Multimodal Benchmark Dataset for Fine-grained Fake News Detection" (LREC 2020)
