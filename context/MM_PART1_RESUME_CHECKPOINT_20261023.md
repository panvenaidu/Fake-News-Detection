<!-- MM-PART1 PRIVATE INPUT ROUTE -->
## Private input route verified on first shard — current checkpoint

Private Kaggle `rocky62/urop-official-images-private-staging-v1`, Version1, was created successfully:640images plus STAGING_README.md,641files/66.74MB, visibilityPrivate. The signed-in upload form showed2.31GB used of214.75GB before this upload. This is an explicitly INCOMPLETE staging input, not the full official benchmark. ZIP compression/byte-level Kaggle roundtrip and full runtime validation remain pending. Kaggle wraps uploaded TARs in the archive basename, observed `images_590bbadd6dcd433b83059f13e85137bc/images/*.jpg`; metadata/runtime verifier now supports this exact `kaggle-tar` layout and its synthetic checks pass. Package small metadata contents as `data.tar` and `results.tar` to produce required root/data and root/results directories. Do not assume a flat images/ path for Kaggle TAR uploads.

CPU job7128d949 recovered24220 committed images and is advancing again:18:29:30UTC47,001 committed plus1,999 in the open shard, required682,661. The old interrupted Cell5 error output caused recurring JavaScript renderer errors. Clearing only that historical output restored reads of current Cell6; source/process were not restarted. T4 synthetic check is complete and its runtime released. Scientific full-cohort epochs/validations remain0/0, no final test; workflow bars unchanged.

Source conflict sample: first640 archive images overlap72 old cached local IDs;21 byte-identical,51 byte-different (24 have different dimensions; none of the51 have exactly equal decoded RGB pixels). This does not establish different semantic image identities. Both collections are preserved, no old images overwritten/reused, and the new experiment uses author-archive bytes. Evidence `results/multimodal_first_shard_byte_comparison_20261023.json`; full overlap audit not claimed. Existing text results unchanged.

<!-- MM-PART1 CUDA PASS -->
## CUDA recovery check passed — 23 October 2026

Short Colab fallback allocated one TeslaT4 (Torch2.11.0+cu130, CUDA13.0). The production Engine/MaximumFusion passed the disposable synthetic fixture with tiny random BERT and full random ResNet50: repeated mid-epoch and validation-pending restoration, next-epoch model/BatchNorm/optimizer/scheduler/scaler/history agreement (maximum state difference0), one actual GradScaler overflow skip, five successful updates and two retained checkpoint generations. Both encoders and the classifier parameters changed. Receipt retrieved to `results/multimodal_cuda_engineering_checks_20261023.json`; pinned source commit1c2634d. This is engineering validation, no faculty-data experiment or performance score. The completed GPU session was released; active-session inventory retained only the CPU image-preparation notebook. Full pretrained/data-I/O throughput remains unmeasured.

First real64MiB shard also downloaded through Chrome, moved immediately into ignored `data/official_paired_v1/cloud_shards/` and independently rehashed/decoded locally:640images,67235840bytes, SHA38b460fcca29986161edc70b717085c5efd85b2ab707eeb099009e9dc4f9490b. The113GB source archive stays off the laptop. Runtime observation timeout did not mean the shard download failed: Chrome's completed-download history and Finder showed the actual artifact. CPU extraction continues separately; new committed shard was independently visible in Drive at18:17UTC. Do not restart it based on transient Connecting/output-renderer errors.

<!-- MM-PART1 EXTENDED CPU JOB -->
## Current CPU job — extended bound, 23 October 2026

Current job `CPU_IMAGE_PREP_7128d94997e84072a77aca9a66bc46c6` started18:05:05UTC in CPU notebook Cell6, bounded8h. The prior4h job was intentionally interrupted after24220 images in6 committed shards; it was healthy, not a failure. Measured image rate suggested6–8h total, so the bound was extended early to avoid a later four-hour prefix replay. One open orphan is preserved/ignored; completed shards survive. The new extractor verifies committed shards and rescans the compressed prefix before producing new images. Source remains private and unchanged; no scientific model training. Previous job observations below are historical.

First640-image metadata was independently retrieved through private Drive preview and matched against local official TSVs (522train/56validation/62test). Full-input metadata/runtime verifier now exists and passed synthetic six-image tests; metadata preparation alone cannot open the image gate. CUDA AMP recovery fixture is authored but not GPU-executed. Plain system Python lacked Transformers; project `.venv-urop/bin/python` is the correct existing test environment. That environment confirmed the CUDA-unavailable guard; no local scientific training. See current receipt and `results/MM_PART1_CLOUD_IMAGE_PREP_20261023.json`.

<!-- MM-PART1 LIVE CPU PREPARATION -->
## Live CPU preparation resumed — 23 October 2026

Allowance reset; the prior usage pause is historical. CPU Colab reconnected and the already-approved Drive access was remounted. Three original faculty TSV checksums/counts passed in the new runtime (564000/59342/59319). The first640 real images passed committed-shard and per-image SHA readback plus complete decode/RGB checks. A bounded4-hour CPU extraction is running in saved notebook Cell5, job `CPU_IMAGE_PREP_3af1eae08d9741d681804165003e0146`, started2026-10-23T17:48:59Z. Latest observed17:51:39Z:640 committed and4360 in the open shard; open-shard bytes are not credited as durable. Source/shards remain private in `/content/drive/MyDrive/UROP/official_images_v1/`; no full source archive on laptop. See `results/MM_PART1_CLOUD_IMAGE_PREP_20261023.json`.

No multimodal scientific epoch/validation/test has run. Full image gate remains false, workflow progress unchanged40%. Do not launch duplicate extraction or call this training. Kaggle private engineering notebook created/named/privacy checked at `https://www.kaggle.com/code/rocky62/urop-mm-part1-engineering-preflight/edit`; editor remains loading, no GPU session started, and user verification was requested. Existing completed text notebook/results unchanged. Next: verify completed source/shards/coverage, private input capacity, actual CUDA recovery and throughput, then registered epochs1–2 only. Minimum+1pp target is unproven and not promised.

# Resume Part1 from verified cloud source

<!-- MM-PART1 CODE AND CLOUD CHECKPOINT -->
## Part 1: trainer implemented; cloud archive staged — 23 October 2026

**Current state: usage-reserve checkpoint, not completed Part1.** User approved the CPU notebook's Drive access; mount succeeded. Google Drive made a private cloud-native copy of the original author archive. Colab observed exact size113,623,359,224bytes, BZh9 header and successful fsync/rename/readback of a tiny probe. Source now at `/content/drive/MyDrive/UROP/official_images_v1/public_images.tar.bz2`, copy ID12YYAoTT2Mnb1eEoIRhuVJ3WmTvFoJXoi. No full archive was downloaded to the laptop. Full compressed SHA/CRC and complete image coverage remain unverified.

Full trainer/config and independent evidence verifier are implemented. CPU synthetic tests against the actual Engine/MaximumFusion passed repeated mid-epoch and validation-pending restoration, next-epoch model/optimizer/scheduler/scaler equality, BatchNorm/dropout, simulated AMP skip, accumulation tail, bounded two-generation storage, no CUDA reseeding by crops and incomplete-data rejection. The evidence verifier passed synthetic full-row-count exports and rejected altered probabilities/IDs/labels/loss. Archive sharding passed small-fixture restart, byte/hash preservation, orphan exclusion and corrupt-shard rejection. These are engineering tests, not research metrics or CUDA certification. The config remains a candidate until measured preflight; no actual scientific run is frozen/launched.

Current full image audit remains75,995 usable,606,666 missing locally;110 duplicate-byte groups cross official splits. No new real image shard or extraction has started. No multimodal epochs/full validations/final test, no trained multimodal recovery checkpoint. BERT text results unchanged. Workflow bars stay text100%, multimodal40%, image20%, overall53%. Minimum aspiration+1pp (validation87.00%, eventual Part2 test86.88%) is not guaranteed.

Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EQr8BSZEzyMpoGyQweXE3rRCkOHPbesU . Authored source mirror: `notebooks/UROP_MM_PART1_IMAGE_PREP_CPU_20261023.ipynb` (not an exported byte-identical notebook). CPU preparation source SHA543c60d78d61182b10052cfd061d90c5bb764f99138a8bc09ae72dbfe93d7354 matches the staged cloud script. Drive FUSE disk_usage reports scratch space (~89GB), not the account's5.39TB quota; source was copied cloud-side to avoid local archive storage. Script uses a remote-quota receipt plus bounded scratch margin; no credentials are exported or account switched.

Latest allowance observation20% short-window/72% weekly remaining: reserve synchronization only; no new large transfer/job. Checkpoint/handoff by10%, hardstop5%. Next after allowance recovers: verify current mount/source, run original three-TSV fetch+hash preflight, prove a first small real image shard, then bounded CPU extraction. Require all682661 images and verified private Kaggle input capacity before GPU replay/throughput checks and epochs1-2. Final test remains Part2. Receipt: `results/MM_PART1_RECEIPT_20261023.json`; source/config/test hashes recorded there. Git backup of this new checkpoint is verified separately; earlier statuses below are historical.

Read the full MM-PART1-v2 plan first. Do not repeat the cloud copy or restart completed text/pilot experiments. Verify receipt/source hashes and account. Current scientific progress is0epochs; engineering tests are separate.

## Final usage handoff

At 2026-10-23T15:12:53.554905+00:00, allowance was7% remaining in the short window and70% weekly. The user's10% handoff threshold has been crossed. No new extraction, transfer or training job was launched. Main checkpoint10a72d1190c8bce15cd3b3b58e4a29ef42b0dcc8 was verified against remote main. This receipt/context update is a separate child commit. Pause the Goal after this handoff is pushed; resume only when the user resumes the work. Part1 is incomplete; use the exact next action in the receipt.

### Latest live preparation observation

2026-10-23T18:33:34.291373+00:00: 51536 committed images and4464 in the open shard, of682661 required. CPU job7128d949 continues bounded to8h from18:05:05UTC. Evidence: `results/mm_part1_cpu_progress_observations_20261023.json`. Scientific epochs0/2 and full validations0/2; test excluded. This update does not increase workflow bars.

## Exact continuation commands after full source extraction

Do not duplicate the current CPU job. Require a successful complete extraction report with682661 usable IDs, CRC consumed and compressed SHA before metadata preparation. Fetch the reviewed tools and their dependencies from the verified project commit into a cloud tools scaffold (`scripts/` plus `collab/`), checking source hashes. Then use:

```sh
python scripts/verify_official_image_shards_v1.py prepare-metadata \
  --source-root /content/drive/MyDrive/UROP/official_images_v1 \
  --output-root /content/drive/MyDrive/UROP/official_input_metadata_v1 \
  --extraction-report /exact/path/to/the/verified/complete/extraction_report.json \
  --layout kaggle-tar
```

The extraction-report argument above is deliberately a placeholder; discover/verify the actual completed report rather than inventing its UUID. The metadata output is separate from original sources/shards. It cannot open the runtime image gate. Package its data-directory contents as `data.tar` and results-directory contents as `results.tar`; Kaggle's observed basename wrapping then yields root/data and root/results. Upload only the original committed image TARs plus these metadata archives into new PRIVATE versions of the existing staging dataset. Keep the first version/history intact; do not publish publicly. Confirm all images/counts/storage and saved version.

In the actual training runtime, use `verify-unpacked --root <immutable-private-input-root> --output <separate-working-receipt.json>` to hash/decode every image before calling the trainer's own full-data guard. Do not point the trainer to runtime scratch that cannot hold the full input. Keep image inputs mounted read-only where possible. Current Kaggle Version1 is only640images/641files. Its ZIP export was still awaiting compression on a fresh page check; no full runtime import or byte-level Kaggle roundtrip is claimed.

CUDA recovery passed on Colab Torch2.11.0+cu130/TeslaT4. Repeat the synthetic CUDA test if actual training uses a different device/software contract; do not treat Colab results as proof for an untested Kaggle environment. Full pretrained BERT/image I/O throughput remains required. Freeze final source/config/environment before the first scientific epoch. Retrieve verified latest recovery and selected weights at every bounded scientific job end. Part1 stops at2 complete train+validation epochs; no final test.
