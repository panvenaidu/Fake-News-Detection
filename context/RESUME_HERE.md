# Resume UROP official text work


## 2026-10-08 14:50 IST — Setup/recovery checkpoint (current)

- User authorized local and GitHub checkpoint updates for every model, and confirmed Chrome-only training; Colab CLI fallback declined. No Colab CLI credentials were granted.
- Official dataset files and their hashes/counts are saved locally; full six-way cohort remains unchanged.
- BERT-base and ModernBERT-base trainer/notebook now save recoverable state every 3,000 batches and at epoch boundaries, including optimizer, scheduler, scaler, random generators, sampler position, history and selected checkpoint. `--resume-attempt` restores a named attempt and preserves completed models.
- Recovery batch ordering passed a CPU sampler check; script and notebook syntax checks passed. Cloud GPU execution/recovery has NOT been tested.
- Chrome application control continues to time out, and the direct Chrome browser provider is unavailable. Training is NOT verified as started; no official-v2 validation/test metrics exist. The prior cloud preflight verified Tesla T4 only.
- Account usage query: 34% remains in five-hour Codex window; reset 2026-10-08 17:35 IST. This is separate from Colab runtime lifetime and GPU limits.
- Next action: restore Chrome automation or upload `notebooks/UROP_OFFICIAL_6WAY_TEXT_20261008.ipynb` in Chrome Colab, select T4 and Run all; verify Drive mount, dataset hashes and the first actual optimizer steps. Preserve exact cloud ATTEMPT path.
- Then sync each model's small JSON/CSV/log evidence under `results/experiments/official_text/`, update these context/log/status files and push milestone documentation. Large TSVs, images and weights remain excluded from Git. Local/GitHub syncing requires a connected agent; cloud checkpoints write independently.

Authoritative runnable notebook: `notebooks/UROP_OFFICIAL_6WAY_TEXT_20261008.ipynb`. Protocol: `configs/text_official_6way_v2.json`. Source: `scripts/train_official_text.py`. Evidence: `results/official_dataset_audit.json`, `results/official_dataset_provenance.json`. Detailed audit: `context/AUDIT_20261008.md`.

## Chrome recovered

Chrome controls recovered; cloud Drive mounted. Observed Python 3.13.15, transformers 5.18.0, torch 2.11.0+cu130, Tesla T4. Official files and pinned training source verified in the notebook. Setup checkpoint pushed to GitHub commit `09876a88d70747cae62e6fac55946a547532e9e8`. Launch-cell browser editing caused a syntax error before training; replaced with a single command. Training start still requires output verification. Updated UTC: 2026-10-08T09:27:14.606751+00:00


## 2026-10-08T09:33:11.547672+00:00 — Cloud startup checkpoint

Chrome recovered; Drive mounted on T4. Observed Python 3.13.15 / transformers 5.18.0 / torch 2.11.0+cu130. Official file/source verification succeeded. Three cloud initialization attempts (20261008T092708Z, 20261008T092745Z, 20261008T092810Z) failed with `AttributeError: Tee object has no attribute isatty` before optimizer steps. Cloud evidence is preserved under `/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/UROP/official_text_runs/`. Fixed stream-method delegation; isatty/encoding/fileno checks and notebook syntax passed locally. Clean relaunch pending; no new validation/test metrics. Chrome-only preference honored. Setup commit 09876a88d70747cae62e6fac55946a547532e9e8 is pushed.


## 2026-10-08T09:39:18.215639+00:00 — Corrected cloud process launched

Pinned fixed source SHA256 `a13c0e5d97b2fe7661ce6a228d43d853f1aca703314cfa48688825b7b01701f9` loaded from pushed commit `9c7abf1`. Colab cell [16] visibly entered Executing state on Tesla T4. This verifies process launch only; first optimizer steps, current attempt folder, and metrics have not yet been observed. BERT runs first; ModernBERT remains queued. Live Chrome controls subsequently became unavailable. Do not rerun launch cells or replace data blindly: inspect current process/output and cloud status before deciding whether a recovery is needed. Latest machine-readable local status: `results/official_text_live_status.json`. Checkpoints write to Drive independently; local and GitHub synchronization needs a connected agent.

Current verification limitation: after cell [16] entered execution, a later accessibility view showed a 4-second elapsed label and no readable subprocess output. Do not treat that as proof of successful training or completion. Chrome terminal opened but no shell prompt/output was available. Inspect latest cloud status/error files when live controls return before relaunching.


## 2026-10-08T09:45:49.174071+00:00 — Usage/recovery checkpoint

Last usage check: 6% remains; five-hour window resets 2026-10-08 17:35 IST. This supersedes the earlier 34% preflight reading. Latest source logging fix and recovery code are pushed. Current cloud training progress is unverified: cell 16 entered execution, but a later accessibility view showed 4 seconds elapsed without readable subprocess output. Do not claim active optimizer steps or metrics. Native Chrome controls/screenshots are unreliable/unavailable and the Chrome terminal has no usable prompt. User was asked to keep the Mac awake/unlocked with Chrome visible; Colab CLI fallback was explicitly declined. Preserve existing cloud attempts; inspect latest model status/error/checkpoint before any rerun. All scientific settings and dataset files remain unchanged.


## 2026-10-08T09:49:32.158683+00:00 — Final continuity checkpoint

All code/config/notebook, dataset provenance, audit, startup errors and current unverified launch state are saved. Checkpoint cadence is implemented (every 3,000 batches and each epoch), but no successful cloud weight checkpoint or optimizer updates have yet been verified. The last available Colab setup screenshot is `results/colab_setup_last_available.png`; it is not live training-progress proof. Attempts to create a continuation heartbeat failed schedule validation, so no automatic follow-up is active. Resume only after checking the existing cloud attempt; do not assume chat usage reset automatically resumes an agent. Chrome-only preference remains in force.


## 2026-10-08T10:03:25.864123+00:00 — Official BERT optimizer steps verified

Chrome Colab runtime recovered. A guarded notebook launch started PID 23054 with verified fixed source SHA256 a13c0e5d97b2fe7661ce6a228d43d853f1aca703314cfa48688825b7b01701f9. Active attempt: `OFFICIAL-6W-TEXT-v2_seed42_20261008T095827Z` in `/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/UROP/official_text_runs/`. Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11JK1wLLVPH8G7_oThnb0YkLMSR4URafF. BERT epoch 1 reached batch 1,000/17,625, with 997 successful optimizer updates and 3 mixed-precision skipped updates, approximately 229.78 titles/second. Checkpoint not yet present at this observation; first is due at batch 3,000. ModernBERT remains queued. No official-v2 validation/test metrics exist yet. Prior cell 16 was interrupted; it is superseded by this verified active attempt. Browser editing produced malformed launch code before this guarded launch; those cells did not train. A repeated execution was blocked by the active-process guard, preventing duplicate training. Keep official splits and scientific settings unchanged; monitor status/checkpoints before any restart. Chrome-only requirement honored.


## 2026-10-08T10:08:03.557939+00:00 — First durable training checkpoint verified

Live Colab monitor observed BERT epoch 1 batch 3,500 / 3,497 optimizer updates, with recovery metadata saved for epoch 1 batch 3,000. Source writes recovery metadata only after the full model/optimizer/scheduler/scaler/RNG checkpoint replaces its temporary file. Active attempt remains OFFICIAL-6W-TEXT-v2_seed42_20261008T095827Z. ModernBERT queued; no validation or test metrics yet. Continuous read-only monitor installed in notebook cell 11; do not rerun this monitor or launch while it is executing.
