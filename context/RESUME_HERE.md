# Resume UROP official text work


## 2026-10-08 14:50 IST — Setup/recovery checkpoint (current)

- User authorized local and GitHub checkpoint updates for every model, and confirmed Chrome-only training; Colab CLI fallback declined. No Colab CLI credentials were granted.
- Official dataset files and their hashes/counts are saved locally; full six-way cohort remains unchanged.
- BERT-base and ModernBERT-base trainer/notebook now save recoverable state every 3,000 batches and at epoch boundaries, including optimizer, scheduler, scaler, random generators, sampler position, history and selected checkpoint. `--resume-attempt` restores a named attempt and preserves completed models.
- Recovery batch ordering passed a CPU sampler check; script and notebook syntax checks passed. Cloud GPU execution/recovery has NOT been tested.
- Chrome application control continues to time out, and the direct Chrome browser provider is unavailable. Training is NOT verified as started; no official-v2 validation/test metrics exist. The prior cloud preflight verified Tesla T4 only.
- Account usage query: 34% remains in five-hour Codex window; reset 2026-10-08 17:35 IST. This is separate from Colab runtime lifetime and GPU limits.
- Next action: restore Chrome automation or upload `notebooks/UROP_OFFICIAL_6WAY_TEXT_20261008.ipynb` in Chrome Colab, select T4 and Run all; verify Drive mount, dataset hashes and the first actual optimizer steps. Preserve exact cloud ATTEMPT path.
- Then sync each model's small JSON/CSV/log evidence under `results/experiments/official_text/`, update these context/log/status files and push milestone documentation. Large TSVs, images and weights remain excluded from Git. Local/GitHub syncing requires a connected agent; cloud checkpoints write independently.
